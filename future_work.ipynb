    "\n",
    "As we continue to refine our intelligent outfit recommendation system, we’ve identified two primary focus areas for future improvements: **Metadata Automation** and **Category Expansion**. These enhancements are aimed at making the system more autonomous, stylishly aware, and capable of completing a user’s look from head to toe.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metadata Automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, metadata such as color, occasion, and sleeve type is manually labeled. To scale and generalize the system for larger wardrobes or more users, we aim to automate this process using vision-based models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Automated Color Detection  \n",
    "We plan to eliminate the need for manual color tagging by building a color detection module that extracts the dominant color directly from the clothing image. This will improve consistency across wardrobe items and enable better filtering through the color combination dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Image-Based Occasion Detection  \n",
    "Instead of relying solely on text inputs for determining occasion, we aim to extend occasion detection through image classification. This would allow the system to infer the event type (e.g., formal, sporty, casual) just by analyzing the visual style of a clothing item — making it smarter and reducing dependency on user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pattern & Texture Recognition  \n",
    "To support richer outfit diversity, we plan to introduce pattern recognition capabilities that can identify solids, stripes, florals, polka dots, and more. This feature would not only enhance visual filtering but also help in creating stylistically coherent outfit suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sleeve-Length Integration  \n",
    "A significant addition will be automated sleeve classification (short, long, sleeveless). The system will then factor in both weather and occasion:\n",
    "- Recommend short sleeves for casual warm-weather occasions\n",
    "- Recommend long sleevesfor cold days\n",
    "- Prioritize long sleeves even in warmer weather for formal settings (to maintain dress code standards)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Category Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "To support complete outfit building beyond tops and bottoms, we plan to broaden our system’s understanding and recommendation capacity across additional fashion categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add New Clothing Categories  \n",
    "We plan to include wardrobe categories such as:\n",
    "- Shoes (e.g., sneakers, heels, boots)\n",
    "- Outerwear (e.g., jackets, coats)\n",
    "- Dresses and skirts for more diverse outfit types\n",
    "\n",
    "These additions will help deliver a full look — not just part of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessory Matching Algorithms  \n",
    "To take personalization further, we plan to build an accessory pairing engine that recommends:\n",
    "- Bags and backpacks\n",
    "- Jewelry\n",
    "- Belts and watches\n",
    "\n",
    "These final touches will allow our system to move beyond basic styling and deliver fully curated fashion experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Evaluation Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Although our project is built around a RAG architecture, standard RAG evaluation frameworks like RAGAS may not fully apply in our context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We’re retrieving structured metadata (wardrobe items with attributes), not text documents.\n",
    "- Our generation task is creative — generating style vibes and casual outfit suggestions — not fact-based answers.\n",
    "- Fashion is inherently subjective; there is no strict “ground truth” for what’s stylish or appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, some lightweight evaluation strategies inspired by RAGAS could still be relevant:\n",
    "- Checking if the retrieved outfit matches the user’s weather and occasion context\n",
    "- Evaluating whether the LLM’s final recommendation aligns with the user prompt\n",
    "- Ensuring high parse success rates and clear vibe distinctions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Vision\n",
    "\n",
    "Our long-term goal is to make the system:\n",
    "- **Fully automated** in metadata generation  \n",
    "- **Context-aware** in outfit recommendations  \n",
    "- **Fashion-forward** in understanding trends, patterns, and accessories  \n",
    "- And most importantly — a true virtual stylist that simplifies decision-making and enhances user confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re building not just an outfit recommender, but a smart styling assistant that adapts, personalizes, and evolves with the user.\n"
