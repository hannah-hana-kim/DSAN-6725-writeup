        "This project set out with a clear and practical mission: to make the user’s life easier and more convenient when it comes to getting dressed. Whether you're rushing out the door for a meeting or casually planning a weekend brunch, we wanted to eliminate the decision fatigue that often comes with choosing what to wear.\n",

        "Imagine this: you’ve got 10 minutes before you need to leave, and no time to try on different outfits. With our intelligent fashion assistant, you can simply describe your situation — and get personalized outfit suggestions, complete with compatibility checks, weather readiness, and style explanations, all in seconds.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make this possible, we combined:\n",
        "- A **ResNet-18 model** for visual understanding of clothing items\n",
        "- A **Siamese Network** to assess outfit compatibility through learned embeddings\n",
        "- A **RAG pipeline with an LLM (Claude)** to interpret user intent and recommend outfits with natural, stylistic language\n",
        "- Real-time tools like **OpenWeatherMap** and **FAISS indexing** to keep recommendations both relevant and responsive\n",
        "\n",
        "The system retrieves only what's appropriate, filters for style, occasion, and temperature, and generates a recommendation that feels thoughtful — almost like getting dressed with a fashion-savvy friend.\n",
        "\n",
        "Looking ahead, we envision expanding this assistant to include more clothing categories, accessory suggestions, and automated metadata extraction — all with one goal in mind:  \n",
        "to simplify and elevate the way users dress, every single day."
