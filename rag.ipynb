        "- **FAISS Index for Similarity Search**:  \n",
        "  We use FAISS to store and quickly retrieve clothing item embeddings. Given a user's query, we use metadata (occasion, temperature, preferences) to search and rank compatible wardrobe items efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Weather Tool (OpenWeatherMap API)**:  \n",
        "  To ensure climate-appropriate suggestions, we fetch real-time temperature data based on the user’s city. If no city is specified, we default to Washington, DC. This helps us avoid suggesting winter coats on hot summer days or sleeveless tops in winter.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Below's the snippet of code that we've built to extract any other city from user's prompt. It might not be the most effecient if the user doesn't capitalise the place, however we found it to be a smarter way to use regex to retrieve the desired location.\n",

        "  This tool analyzes the user’s natural language input to determine the dressing context — such as a date, job interview, gym session, or casual hangout. It maps keywords in the prompt to predefined occasion categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Below is the function that we've defined to parse the user's message to fetch the 7 categories of occasions.\n",

        "  Users often express preferences like \"I want to wear a t-shirt, not a shirt.\" The preference parser extracts such constraints to guide wardrobe filtering more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Color Combination Dictionary**:  \n",
        "  We maintain a curated color compatibility dictionary where each base color is mapped to visually harmonious options. This ensures that the suggested outfits not only make sense contextually, but also look good together.\n",
