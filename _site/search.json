    "text": "Once the images were segmented, we extracted features from each using a ResNet-18 model. Resnet is one of the well-known models for image classification, and it was perfect for our data since Resnet is the best model for feature extraction. We were able to achieve 99.3% of accuracy from this model.\nOnce we achieved high accuracy, not only did we use cloth embeddings but we also built a similarity index using Faiss and saved our feature extraction model for use in the later stages.\nWhen evaluating the model, we tested similarity queries for random and top 5 matches, and also analyzed intra- and inter-class distances to confirm whether the embeddings were valid or not. We also visualized the embedding space using t-SNE, which showed clear separation between the categories.\nThese embeddings were essential for the second model, which we’ll get into next.”"
